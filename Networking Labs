# Networking Labs

This repository contains networking SOPs, labs, and study notes as I continue developing my networking skills.  
It includes:

- **SOPs** â€“ step-by-step troubleshooting guides for real-world issues  
- **Labs** â€“ notes and configurations from Packet Tracer, GNS3, and home lab practice  
- **Study Notes** â€“ summaries from Professor Messer, Dion training, and practice exams  

ðŸ“Œ Goal: Build strong networking fundamentals for systems & infrastructure engineering roles, while creating a public knowledge base that others can learn from.
